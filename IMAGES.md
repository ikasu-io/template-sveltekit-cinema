# Images

The photos in `src/lib/images/` were generated with AI for this fictional
site. They do not show real places, people or films.

- **Model:** Google Gemini (image generation), October 2026
- **Prompts:** one shared style description plus one prompt per image,
  kept in the maintainer's brief for this template
- **Processing:** cropped to their aspect ratio and scaled to at most
  1600 px wide; the build converts them to WebP in four widths
- **Licence:** like the rest of this repository, the images are under the
  [MIT licence](LICENSE). You may use, change and redistribute them,
  including in your own site.

Images from Gemini carry Google's invisible SynthID watermark, which marks
them as AI-generated.

The film posters are not images: they are drawn in CSS from each film's
title and colour (`src/lib/components/Poster.svelte`). The logo and
favicon are SVG drawings made for this site, under the same licence. The
fonts Big Shoulders Display and Literata are under the SIL Open Font
License (`static/fonts/OFL-*.txt`).
